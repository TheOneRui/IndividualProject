•	To investigate the Probabilistic Envelope of Frequency Responses output from the SFR model.
•	To investigate the frequency responses when attempting to compensate for the transient frequency dip. 
•	To investigate the effects of the Margin of Error specific to each average variable on the SFR model
•	Evaluate the effects of the estimation of H on the viability of the application of OFFC
•	Define an acceptable range of H from the estimated value of H, in the OFFC use case
